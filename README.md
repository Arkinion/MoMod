To open in eclipse, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and extract it to where you want to work.
2. Open either command prompt or powershell in the directory you extracted to.
IMPORTANT: In the following steps, you will be asked to run a command called "gradlew". If you are using powershell, you will need to use "./gradlew" in its place.
3. Run the following command: "gradlew setupDecompWorkspace".
4. Run the following command: "gradlew eclipse".
5. Open eclipse and create an empty eclipse workspace (if you don't already have one).
6. On the menu bar, click File > Import then General > Existing Project
7. Import your files from your extracted repository directory.
8. Profit!
